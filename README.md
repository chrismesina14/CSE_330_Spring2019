# CSE 330: Data Structures
The objective of the course is to learn why and how a data structure is chosen to solve a problem. This learning process is done repeatedly through the exercise of introducing and analyzing a problem, and then converging toward the best data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. Along the way, one must consider and maintain correctness, time and space complexity, brevity, and elegance. In this process other objectives of the course are also realized, in the order of importance, they are:
- To practice Object Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming
(OOA/D/P).
- To get exposed to Standard Template Library (STL).
- To become more proficient in C++ and Unified Modeling Language (UML).
